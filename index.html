                    <p>There is no gain without pain. To be a good writer, you need to be a good reader and with a checklist of one to a ten, reading is listed at the tenth position. 
                    I only have an interest in reading, when it is relating to sports or a compulsory event like sitting an exam. 
                    Critical Reading and Writing in the Disciplines (FOUN1019) is a first-year course which is geared towards improving students’ reading comprehension and also developing their writing skills; 
                    that is to write in different styles and modes.  It also allows students to proofread their work effectively, locating and correcting grammatical and sentence structure errors which occur in their writing. 
                    I enjoy writing creatively and hate the idea of reading. Creative writing allows me to express myself in more ways than one. I have the aspiration of becoming a writer but my attitude towards reading is lackadaisical; 
                    not wanting to turn a page or take a newspaper to read,  however, I find myself trying to get an article to read and broaden my reading scope.</p>

                    <p>My FOUN1019 journey has been rewarding. I have become an active reading and I am starting to also enjoy academic writing. 
                    I intend on practicing what I have learnt from this course in other courses and also for leisure purpose. If it is not said aloud then I will be shouting it out to the public; 
                    FOUN1019 is important and should be given more attention and credit by all UWI students. I came into this course as flour and leaving like a dumpling. 
                    This course has improved my reading and change my negligent attitude to being positive and more open to reading and also on a wider scale.</p>
